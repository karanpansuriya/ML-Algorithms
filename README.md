## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karanpansuriya/ML-Algorithms.git
   cd ML-Algorithms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   You can install the main dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install individually:
